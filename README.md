AI Platform with Interactive Particle Morphing

The Particle Morphing LLM Template is a modern, interactive web platform that acts as a bridge between your company’s AI infrastructure and the end user.

It provides a fully customizable, particle-based user interface that connects to any Large Language Model (LLM) via API, allowing users to interact securely with internal AI services without exposing private or company data.

The entire website—including navigation, pages, and UI components—is designed to be fully extensible and customizable, making it easy to add new AI services, tools, or workflows as your platform evolves.

Beyond basic LLM interaction, the template also includes:

A dedicated AI agent platform where you can track executed tasks, capabilities, and agent behavior

A Machine Learning section for integrating and running model training workflows

For maximum data privacy and enterprise use cases, the platform is ideally suited for self-hosted or cloud-deployed models (such as Azure AI Foundry or other providers), ensuring that all data remains within your organization.

In short, this project serves as a secure, modular LLM bridge—connecting users to powerful AI capabilities through a modern, customizable web experience.
